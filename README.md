# Excavator webpage
This is a webpage used to visualize the excavator detector made with `YOLOv8`. Users can upload images, getting feedback after a few seconds.


## Technical details
### Change model
If you want to use a different model, replace the `MODEL_PATH` at the beginning of the `object_detector.js`. However, this demo program was not written to be reused in other models, and the user should therefore not expect other models than the excavator model to run. (* do not models with a other resolution than 640x640 px.)

### No furture changes done
The interns ended up not expanding the page, but attempted to leave as clean code as possible without doucmentation

### Future changes
This program may see future changes depending on the time schedule of the summer interns.
